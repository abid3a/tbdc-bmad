## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This is the first story, so no previous insights available.

### Data Models
Based on the architecture documents, the following data models will be relevant:
- **Companies**: `uid`, `name`, `industry`, `contact_info`, `team_members[]`, `credit_balance`, `cohort` [Source: architecture/key-modules.md#Companies]
- **Users**: Authentication handled through Supabase Auth with role-based permissions [Source: architecture/auth-permissions.md]

### API Specifications
- **Supabase Client**: Primary backend API for all data operations [Source: architecture/system-overview.md]
- **Authentication Endpoints**: Login, logout, user session management through Supabase Auth
- **Role-based Access**: Companies only see sessions tied to their assigned cohort [Source: architecture/key-modules.md#Sessions]

### Component Specifications
- **Sidebar Navigation**: Collapsible on mobile, includes main navigation items [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- **Responsive Layout**: Tailwind-based layout with full mobile/kiosk/desktop responsiveness [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- **Protected Route Wrapper**: Component to handle role-based access control

### File Locations
Based on the proposed folder structure:
- Supabase client: `lib/supabaseClient.ts` [Source: architecture/folder-structure.md]
- Authentication utilities: `lib/auth.ts` [Source: architecture/folder-structure.md]
- Main layout components: `components/` directory [Source: architecture/folder-structure.md]
- Pages: `pages/` directory with index.tsx as home [Source: architecture/folder-structure.md]

### Testing Requirements
No specific testing guidance found in architecture docs, but standard React/Next.js testing practices should be followed.

### Technical Constraints
- **Frontend**: React (Next.js), Tailwind CSS, ShadCN UI [Source: architecture/system-overview.md]
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, RLS, Storage) [Source: architecture/system-overview.md]
- **Hosting**: Vercel or Netlify (for frontend), Supabase (for backend) [Source: architecture/system-overview.md]
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL [Source: architecture/system-overview.md]

### Project Structure Notes
The project should follow the proposed folder structure from `docs/architecture/folder-structure.md`:
- Components in `/components/` directory
- Pages in `/pages/` directory with subdirectories for each main feature
- Utilities in `/lib/` directory
- Supabase schema in `/supabase/schema.sql`

## Testing
No specific testing standards found in architecture docs. Follow standard React/Next.js testing practices with Jest and React Testing Library.
